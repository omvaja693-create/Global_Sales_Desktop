# Global Sales Data Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize global sales performance. The dashboard provides deep insights into sales trends, profitability, and customer behavior across various regions and product categories. It serves as a data-driven tool for stakeholders to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and make informed business decisions.

## Features

* **Key KPI Tracking**: Visualizes critical metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, and Order Volume at a glance.
* **Geographic Analysis**: Interactive maps showing sales distribution across different countries and regions.
* **Temporal Trends**: Time-series analysis to identify seasonal patterns and growth trends in sales and profit.
* **Product Performance**: Detailed breakdown of sales and profit margins by product category and sub-category.
* **Shipping & Logistics Analysis**: Insights into shipping costs and delivery times to optimize supply chain efficiency.
* **Interactive Filtering**: Users can slice and dice data by year, region, segment, and category for personalized views.

## Data Model & Structure

The dashboard is built on a robust data model utilizing a **Star Schema** for optimal performance:

* **Fact Table**: Contains core sales transaction data, including revenue, profit, quantity, and discount details.
* **Dimension Tables**:
* **Calendar/Date Table**: Enables advanced Time Intelligence calculations (YTD, YoY growth).
* **Product Table**: Contains product attributes like names, categories, and sub-categories.
* **Geography Table**: Details on regions, countries, states, and cities.
* **Customer Table**: Segment information (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office).



## DAX Measures

Advanced **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** measures were implemented to provide dynamic calculations, including:

* Total Sales and Total Profit.
* Profit Margin percentages.
* Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Growth.
* Moving averages for sales trend smoothing.

## Technology Stack

* **Tool**: Microsoft Power BI Desktop.
* **Data Source**: Global Sales CSV/Excel datasets.
* **Modeling**: Power Query (M Language) for ETL processes and DAX for analytical calculations.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have **Power BI Desktop** installed.
2. Download the `Global sales data dash baord.pbix` file from this repository.
3. Open the file to interact with the visualizations and explore the data model.
